# Audio Streaming Fixes Summary

## Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Import
- **Issue**: Code used `time.time()` without importing the `time` module
- **Fix**: Added `import time` to imports

### 2. Race Conditions in Bot Speaking State
- **Issue**: Multiple async tasks were accessing `bot_is_speaking` flag without synchronization
- **Fix**: Added `speech_lock = asyncio.Lock()` for thread-safe access to shared state

### 3. Improper ElevenLabs WebSocket Connection
- **Issue**: API key was being sent in message body instead of headers
- **Fix**: Moved API key to WebSocket headers using `extra_headers` parameter

### 4. Audio Format Conversion Issues
- **Issue**: PCM to mu-law conversion wasn't handling edge cases properly
- **Fix**: Improved error handling and sample rate conversion logic

### 5. Interruption Logic Problems
- **Issue**: Bot interruption wasn't properly cancelling TTS tasks
- **Fix**: Added proper task cancellation with exception handling

### 6. Speech Gap Detection
- **Issue**: Not implementing the 2-second gap requirement for contiguous sentences
- **Fix**: Added logic to reset transcript buffer when speech gaps exceed 2 seconds

## Key Behavioral Improvements

### User Interruption Handling
- When user speaks while bot is talking, bot immediately stops
- TTS task is properly cancelled and cleaned up
- Twilio receives "clear" message to stop audio playback

### Speech Detection
- Only processes contiguous speech without 2+ second gaps
- Discards transcripts when bot is speaking
- Improved volume threshold detection for speech vs silence

### Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks around WebSocket operations
- Graceful handling of connection closures
- Better logging for debugging

## Configuration Changes

### Timing Adjustments
- `SILENCE_THRESHOLD`: Changed to 2.0 seconds (as requested)
- `utterance_end_ms`: Changed to 2000ms in Deepgram URL

### ElevenLabs Configuration
- Added proper voice settings and generation config
- Improved audio chunk processing with `isFinal` detection

## Testing

Run the connection test script to verify all APIs are working:

```bash
python app/test_connections.py
```

This will test:
- Deepgram WebSocket connection
- OpenAI API connection  
- ElevenLabs WebSocket connection

## Usage Flow

1. **User speaks**: Audio goes to Deepgram for transcription
2. **User stops speaking**: After 2s silence, transcript goes to OpenAI
3. **AI responds**: OpenAI response goes to ElevenLabs for TTS
4. **Audio streams back**: ElevenLabs audio streams to Twilio/user
5. **User interrupts**: If user speaks while AI is talking, AI stops immediately

The system now properly handles the conversational flow with interruptions as requested.
